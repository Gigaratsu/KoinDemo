Hello and welcome.

This is a small sample project to demonstrate my use and understanding of the Koin library in which to centralize and optimize resources in different scopes.

The project is meant to imitate an authenticated user by having them provide a username and their first name, of which would then be accessible to the current Profile page.

This usage of the user's info could be further expanded into other activities and fragments as necessary to maintain a MVVM-style architecture where the views call the ViewModel in order to obtain information necessary to display.
